# If you store large HBuilderX tarballs elsewhere, don't include them here unless you
# want the build to use the local tarball. To force download, keep the tarball out of
# the build context.

# NOTE: If you want to use a local HBuilderX tarball with the Dockerfile's
# `final-local` stage, place it at `hbuilderx/HBuilderX.tar.gz` in the project root
# and DO NOT add `hbuilderx/` to this file. If you prefer forcing remote download,
# you can add `hbuilderx/` here to exclude local tarballs from the build context.

# By default ignore everything to keep build context small, but allow hbuilderx/ when present.
